I am a research scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, associated with the Astrolavos Lab. My primary research focuses on the intersection of Usable Web Security, Web Attacks and Defenses, Network Attack and Defenses, and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in finding innovative solutions that enhance the security of the web and networks.I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Georgia, where I had the privilege of collaborating with <a href="https://roberto.perdisci.com"> Roberto Perdisci </a> in his esteemed Network and Security Intelligence lab. During my time there, I gained valuable expertise and knowledge in the field. My ultimate goal is to leverage my passion for this domain to make cybersecurity more accessible and user-friendly. By bridging the gap between complex security measures and end users, I aspire to contribute to a safer online environment for everyone.
