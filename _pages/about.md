I'm a research scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am affiliated with Astrolavos Lab.My research interests lie on the intersection of Usable Web security, Web Attacks and Defenses, Network Attack and Defenses and Machine Learning. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Georgia, where I had the opportunity to work with <a href="https://roberto.perdisci.com"> Roberto Perdisci </a> in his lab Network and Security Intelligence. My goal is to drive my passion for this field to make cybersecurity more accessible and user-friendly.
