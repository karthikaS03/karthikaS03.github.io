I am a research scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, affiliated with the Astrolavos Lab. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Georgia, where I had the privilege of collaborating with <a href="https://roberto.perdisci.com"> Roberto Perdisci </a> in his Network and Security Intelligence lab.


As a security researcher, I focus on investigating the security postures of Web and Network Technologies.  In my doctoral and postdoctoral work at UGA and GTech, I have designed, built
and evaluated systems that measure and detect large-scale abuse of well-established as well as
newly developed web and network technologies. This often entails a holistic approach that integrates security expertise, data mining techniques, browser instrumentation, customized crawlers, and cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning methodologies.


<!-- My research primarily explores the intersection of Usable Web Security, Web Attacks and Defenses, and Network Attack and Defenses. Most of my publications feature innovative solutions that quantify various forms of abuse and offer insights critical for developing defenses. This often involves scaling solutions through automation,, gaining a deep understanding of the attacks in question, and applying Machine Learning techniques to specific tasks.  -->

<!-- During my time there, I gained valuable expertise and knowledge in the field.  -->

<!-- I aim to channel my passion for this field towards my goal of making cybersecurity more accessible and user-friendly. 
By bridging the gap between intricate security measures and end users, I'm on a mission to create a safer online world for everyone â€” one paper at a time. -->
