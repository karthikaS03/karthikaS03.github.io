I'm a research scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am affiliated with Astrolavos Lab.My research interests lie on the intersection of Usable Web security, Web Attacks and Defenses, Network Attack and Defenses and Machine Learning. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Georgia, where I had the opportunity to work with <a href="https://roberto.perdisci.com"> Roberto Perdisci </a> in his lab Network and Security Intelligence. My goal is to drive my passion for this field to make cybersecurity more accessible and user-friendly.

 <!-- My goal is to enhance online security and protect users from malicious attacks by researching new methodologies, and also utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent cyber attacks.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
